## Context

This project was created as a technical assignment during Sorare recruiting process for a frontend engineer position.

### Part 1, 2 and 3

These parts of the homework are the code itself where each part can be found on a different commit.


### Part 4

*Question: From there, how would you proceed to generate a PNG version of the card? (no code required)*

The easiest way for me to generate a PNG version in a frontend environnement would be to use the [html2canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2canvas) javascript library as discussed in that article for example https://blog.logrocket.com/export-react-components-as-images-html2canvas.

### Possible improvements

- Generate types from GraphQL API instead of creating them manually
- Use images as card background to make the cards prettier and more customized (could also use some animated background with particles to make them even more customized)
- Add the possibility to reveal card one by one in addition to the "reveal cards" action button (like in Sorare application)

## Setup

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as it is the recommanded way of creating new React project according to the official document.

Setup is very easy using yarn command:
```
yarn
```

 ## Running

 To run the project, you can use:
 ```
 yarn start
 ```

 Project will be accessible on http://localhost:3000.

## How it works ?

The project is listing some cards on http://localhost:3000/cards page. 

To display some cards you need to add Sorare slug name after the url separated with a comma.

#### Example

```
http://localhost:3000/cards/marco-verratti-2021-rare-1,kylian-mbappe-lottin-2020-super_rare-1
```

This page will display two different cards, one rare of Marco Verratti and one super rare of Kylian Mbapp√©.

The cards are hidden by default, to reveal them you need to click on the "Reveal cards" button as they will flip to reveal the other side of the cards.
